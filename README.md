# autocorrect

If you're here, I suppose you either came from my YouTube channel, if not then you found it yourself.

This script is an simple basic autocorrect system I thought of before sleeping some time ago.

You don't really need to credit me but it would be motivating if you do so.

Good luck, and have a nice day!
